# SimpleWeatherApp
I started to learn microweb framework "Flask" and after that, I decided to apply my skills to develop this simple weather app. Here, when you include the City name, It will show you the City Name, Date, Temperature and Weather Description. This App is developed using Python for the backend and for the User Interface, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
